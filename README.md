# ft_ping
ft_ping is a project from 42 School aimed at recoding the GNU/UNIX utility Ping in C.

The main purpose is to understand the lower network layers and associated protocols and headers such as ICMP and UDP, as well as  opening sockets and sending Raw packets .

# To make it work:
Clone the repository and make: it will update the libft's tool, compile the source and create the binary ft_ping.

Then run it with the IP address or the website's name: (don't forget the sudo !)
